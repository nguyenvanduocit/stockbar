## User Stories

Based on your request, here are the revised user stories excluding the third and fourth ones:

1. **User Story 1**: As a stock trader, I want to see the real-time price of a specific stock on my macOS menubar so that I can monitor its price without needing to open a browser or another application.

   Acceptance Criteria:
   - The stock price is displayed on the macOS menubar.
   - The stock price is updated in real-time.
   - The stock price is accurate and fetched from a reliable API.

2. **User Story 2**: As a stock trader, I want to input the stock code of the stock I wish to monitor so that the application can display its real-time price.

   Acceptance Criteria:
   - There is an intuitive interface for inputting the stock code.
   - The input field accepts valid stock codes.
   - The input field rejects invalid stock codes and provides an error message.

These user stories are written following the agile methodology and focus on the MVP and non-functional requirements. They are doable and provide a clear direction for the developers to start working on the application.
