Consider a user who is a stock trader employing a short-term trading strategy.

This user purchases stocks when they anticipate a price increase and sells stocks when they predict a price decrease in the near future.

The crux of successful short-term trading lies in identifying the optimal moments to buy and sell stocks.

While the user has developed a keen sense of timing, they require real-time price checks to validate their instincts.

Therefore, they need an efficient tool to monitor prices in real time. Using a web browser for this purpose proves inefficient as it requires opening the browser and typing the URL each time they wish to check the price.

The user's requirement is a tool that allows them to monitor stock prices in real time with a single glance.
