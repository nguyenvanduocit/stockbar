Based on the ideas and requirements provided, here's a simplified and detailed version of the requirements for the MVP:

Functional Requirements:

1. **Stock Price Display**: The app should display the real-time price of a single stock on the macOS menubar. This feature should be always visible when the user is logged in to their macOS system, providing a quick glance at the current stock price.

2. **Stock Code Input**: The app should allow the user to input the stock code of the stock they wish to monitor. This feature should be accessible through a simple and intuitive interface, possibly a dropdown menu or a text input field in the app settings.

Non-Functional Requirements:

1. **Accuracy**: The app should provide accurate and up-to-date stock prices. The data should be fetched from a reliable stock price API and updated at regular intervals to ensure real-time accuracy.

2. **Performance**: The app should have a fast response time. The stock price updates should not cause any noticeable delay or lag in the system's performance.

3. **Compatibility**: The app should be compatible with macOS. It should be developed and tested specifically for this operating system to ensure seamless integration and performance.

4. **User-Friendly Input Process**: The input process for the stock code should be user-friendly and intuitive. It should guide the user through the process, possibly with placeholder text or tooltips, and validate the input to prevent errors.

By focusing on these core features and requirements, we can ensure that the MVP is simple, efficient, and meets the user's needs.
